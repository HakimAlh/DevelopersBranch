# DevsBranch

## Welcome to DevsBranch!
A community-driven forum for developers and even non-developers to share thoughts about development and coding. A place where you can talk or ask questions related to coding languages. Problems that others may face to be the same as yours! It can be a place for solution or a place to share your amazing development!

## Planned Future Enhancements
To improve the UI and improve overall User experience. Adding more features which gives more options to User, allowing them to be more flexible. And adding groups or organization similar to Github's organization where users can follow and get along.

## Why DevsBranch name?
DevsBranch is named the way it is because just like GitHub's branches. We have branches of Developers, and we 'push' codes or solutions to other developers to 'pull'. It was named
DevelopersBranch but I shortened it to DevsBranch.

## Why did you choose this kind of app for the project?
Because I see how a lot of developers use websites such as 'Stack Overflow' and I take inspiration. I love to work on something that'll benefit other developers and even non-developers. Sharing their thoughts and sharing problems others can help solving brings a really nice community. Which is why I chose to go with something with the inspiration of a 'Coding Forum'
